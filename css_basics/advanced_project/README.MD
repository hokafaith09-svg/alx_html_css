# Advanced HTML & CSS Project

## Objective
This project focuses on advanced CSS styling and creating a polished web page based on a Figma design. The goal is to reproduce the layout, fonts, colors, and images as closely as possible.

## Files
- `index.html` – Main webpage
- `styles.css` – All CSS styling
- `images/` – Folder containing all images and logos

## Notes
- Fonts used: Source Sans Pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- Some layout values are in float; they have been rounded for simplicity
- The page is responsive and uses modern CSS techniques like Flexbox
